    <h1>Well, Let's Start</h1>
    <p>I started learning programming languages with C and C++ in 2008 at Fatih University which then 
    followed by Python between 2013 - 2015 by myself. Afterwords, I used Arduino boards to built some
    projects, for instance, an automated irrigation system. In September 2021, I joined Clarusway 
    Full Stack Webb Development course so that I enhanced my programming skills by learning more and more:
    HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, React, Python, Django and so on.  </p>
